   DATA LAYER
   ----------
   All pages read products through getProducts() / saveProducts().
   On the very first visit the SEED_PRODUCTS array below is copied into
   localStorage.  Every subsequent read/write goes through localStorage so
   that admin edits (add / remove / update) are immediately visible on the
   customer-facing pages without a backend.

   TO ADD A NEW PRODUCT: use the Admin Portal (admin.html → Add Product).
